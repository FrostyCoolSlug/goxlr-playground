# This project is now achived.
After several years working on the GoXLR, and plans to make a 'better' version of the Utility, I'm now generally retiring from GoXLR work. And as such, this repository is now being archived.

I'm still happy to provide my knowledge of the GoXLR for anyone who would like to continue here, will endorse forks, and help manage communities which come from this code, but for me personally, this is being archived as I have no intention of further developing it.

## A Playground for messing around with the GoXLR

Code here is experimental, and not designed to be used with a regular GoXLR, it's mostly where I come to try out new things and play about a bit :)
