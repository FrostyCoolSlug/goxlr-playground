# GoXLR IPC Module

The IPC module is a list of structures and accessors which are used to communicate with the `goxlr-daemon` crate from
external entities.

If you're making a client, you should simply need to include this crate, and all the heavy lifting is done for you, you
can simply proceed with making calls.
